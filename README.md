# ü§ñ Project: ARMANDO Robotic Manipulator Simulation (4 DoF)
Course: Robotic Lab 

Student: Giuseppe Lucino / P38000340

# üéØ Project Objective
The objective of this project is the creation of a ROS 2 workspace containing the necessary packages for the simulation of a 4 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robotic manipulator, named Armando, within the Gazebo simulation environment, using ROS 2 Humble and ros2_control.

# üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
To compile and run the project, it is necessary to have the essential dependencies for ROS 2 and Gazebo installed. After logging into your container or virtual machine, be sure to install:

```bash
# Package update
 sudo apt update
# Optional GUI tools for debugging and visualization
 sudo apt install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui
 sudo apt install ros-humble-rqt-image-view
```

# 3. üèóÔ∏è BUILD
Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository into the desired folder :

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/giuseppelucino/rl25_homework1.git
```
```bash
 colcon build
 source install/setup.bash
```
# üöÄ HOW TO LAUNCH
Visualization Robot (Rviz2)

To see only the kinematic model of the robot and its frames in RViz2:

```bash 
 ros2 launch armando_description armando_display.launch.py
```

Complete Simulation (Gazebo)
The main launchfile loads the robot in Gazebo and starts the controllers (ros2_control).

Default Control Mode (Position): Starts the joint position controller.
```bash
 ros2 launch armando_gazebo armando_world.launch.py
```
Position Control Mode (Position): Starts the joint position controller.
```bash
 ros2 launch armando_gazebo armando_world.launch.py controller_mode:=position.
```
Trajectory Mode (requires external node): Starts the joint trajectory controller.
```bash
 ros2 launch armando_gazebo armando_world.launch.py controller_mode:=trajectory
```
#  üïπÔ∏è INTERACTION AND CONTROL
Manual Position Control (Test)

To send a specific position setpoint to the joints (only in position mode), where the values are in the order [j0, j1, j2, j3] in radians:
Open a new terminal and run the source command.
Send the commands:
```bash
# Zero Position (to stabilize the robot)
 ros2 topic pub --rate 10 /arm_position_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "{data: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}"
```

To visualize the real-time video feed from the simulated camera in Gazebo: Launch rqt_image_view (after running source in a new terminal) and select the /camera/image topic:
```bash
 ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```
# üîç VERIFICATION AND DEBUGGING
To confirm correct operation and monitor the system status:

Active Controller Verification

To confirm that the controllers have been loaded and started correctly:
```bash
 ros2 control list_controllers
```
To see all running nodes:
```bash
 ros2 node list
```
To see all topics:
```bash
 ros2 topic list
```
